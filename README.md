# second-run

Scrapes theater web sites to generate a list of movies currently playing in "second run" theaters, and (not yet implemented) notifies users when movies they want to see are playing in such theaters.

Background:

In portland, second run theaters are often known as "beer & pizza" movie theaters, and some people prefer them to conventional theaters. However, it's hard to remember to check those theaters for movies a couple of months after they come out. I'd like a service that allows me to specify the movies that I'd like to see, and reminds me when they hit those theaters.

This code can actually be used for any theater, so "second-run" is more about my intention than its capabilities.
